This app is about eating burgers. A user can select a burger from a list of burgers on the left side of the page and can click the "devour" button to eat it. Once eaten, that burger will appear on the devoured list on the right side of the page. Also, there is a order button where the user can create any kind of burger and it will show up on the non-devoured burger list on the left. There is also a button to reorder the devoured burger. 
This app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

The MVC design is required and MYSQL,Node, Express, Handlebars, and ORM are used in this app.
